# CharPalette

A Character Map that's good enough, customizable, and most importantly, looks good and copies quickly. For souls who don't want to use Windows' ugly built-in tool.

## Why CharPalette?

Have you ever opened the Windows Character Map and felt your life was meaningless? I have.

CharPalette was born to solve that mess. It doesn't do everything, but what it does, it does well:

-   **Minimalist, modern interface:** Makes you want to use it, not close it.
-   **Superfast copy:** One click and the character is in your clipboard. No fuss.
-   **Fully customizable:** You can add your own character sets. Want to add emojis? Math symbols? Ancient scripts? Go for it.

*P.S. If you find it useful, great. If not... well, that's your problem.*
